In 2020 our visit to the Port of Albany gave them just that. An opportunity to learn about renewable energy, and why it is so important to create and live in a clean environment. During the visit our youth learned about how the windmills work and how large the wingspan of a turbine is. Our youth were engaged and asked questions to the Port of Albany staff about the environmental impact the facility will have on the surrounding communities, if the jobs created will be accessible to the local residents and if so, how many jobs are currently available? At the culmination of the day the youth and the staff from the City of Albany Department of Recreation - Youth and Workforce Services came together as a team to create a board of all the key information gathered during the visit to be presented to the Port of Albany staff. Our youth were provided with lots of great feedback about the content of their presentations and their public speaking skills. They left feeling enthusiastic and empowered by a day filled with new experiences and a new network of professionals they can continue to connect with along their employment journey."

However, by her second or third week of work, she had improved immensely. She completed her tasks flawlessly, became much chattier and open during our conversations, and began to develop relationships with her coworkers and supervisors. Nhyrobie was always on time for work and never missed a day. During the hours that she was there, she worked diligently and efficiently to complete all of her tasks. At the end of the summer program, Nhyrobie’s supervisor suggested that she apply to CVS directly so that she could continue to be a part of their team. Nhyrobie completed the lengthy application process and was hired on to continue working as a CVS employee. Nhyrobie grew tremendously throughout the summer program and is well on her way to learning the skills needed for future self-sustainability.",

        copy: `Julia started going to The Salvation Army earlier in the year as a program participant in her High School After School program and volunteered for their Elementary After School Program. She was very shy but quickly became comfortable because she loved having a role helping with the kids. 

        The Salvation Army encouraged her to apply for SYEP because they felt it would help with her growth and provide her with a great experience. She successfully applied for SYEP 2020. Her primary job duty was to assist with summer children and food programming, but she helped overall wherever it was needed as part of the team. 
        
        She was excited to be involved on an official level and although things were quite different due to COVID, she was extremely flexible and played a crucial role in filling in gaps in programming. Julia took responsibility for the summer feeding program for Galway schools (a local school district). She learned how to manage the program quickly and within a week was making sure everything was executed efficiently and properly by herself. She even successfully recruited volunteers to assist with the program! 
        
        This SYEP Shining Star was described as “blossoming” and having “made major strides considering how shy she was” and the worksite is excited to see what her future will hold. 
        
        Julia stated the following about her SYEP 2020 experience:
        “I really enjoyed the summer work program. I learned there are many people in our country that are less fortunate than me. I was glad to be a part of a team that could help feed them and make them smile. I learned about clocking hours and managing money and also things about banking, ID requirements and my social security number. I was even able to help my mom a little bit with our bills and that made me feel really good. I am excited about working with the summer youth program again next year. Thank you so much for this experience and opportunity!”`,

        copy: `Warren County's Summer Youth Employment Program concluded another successful season, culminating in a virtual awards ceremony on August 28, 2020. Due to the pandemic, this year's program faced new challenges including a late start date. Worksites had to have safety plans in place and the work provided to the participating youth had to be primarily outdoors and able to allow for proper social distancing. The group of young participants were exceptional workers who rose to the challenges in order to flourish in their roles. Duties performed at participating worksites include preparing and serving lunch through Operation Food Chain's summer lunch program; staining wood planks at Square Nail Rustics; feeding and caring for animals at Blackberry Hill Farm; and outdoor maintenance at The Fort William Henry, The Georgian Resort, Cornell Cooperative Extension, Warrensburg Parks and Recreation, the Town of Johnsburg, and the Thurman Highway Department. Supervisors at each site were impressed with the positive attitudes and eagerness of their youth employees while the teens seemed to genuinely enjoy their experience as well. While the program typically concludes with an in-person celebratory picnic, this year's SYEP celebration went virtual. Youth participants joined in a Zoom presentation highlighting each worksite and showing photos and videos of the teens in action. Teen participants were honored with certificates recognizing distinct traits that they displayed throughout the program. The highest honor, "Employee of the Summer," was granted to John Briggss. John's supervisors at Warrensburg Parks and Recreation described him as being the most polite teenager and were beyond impressed with his ability to seamlessly work alongside his adult colleagues as well as his willingness to perform any task asked of him.

G applied for the Summer Youth Employment Program in early July and completed enrollment in the WIOA Youth program in August. G needed a work experience that could lead to employment to help her become self-sufficient. We offered her a work placement at Subway. She began working approximately 30 hours per week and she started working on her Job Corps requirements. Along the way we learned that she was living in a camper on the family property which would only be available until the end of October. Not only did she need employment but she also needed stable housing. Typically, SYEP workers at Subway, work in a support position doing cleaning, dishes and general support of the other staff. G quickly settled in and became an asset. She was cross trained for a "Sandwich Artist" position and at the end of SYEP was offered a position with the company. G's hard work, great customer service skills and strong work ethic paid off as she was able to move out of the camper before the cold weather started and into an apartment she shares with others. She completed her Job Corps requirements and is finding her way to independence. Although her training is in Industrial Painting, G recognizes that for now, this job is a good fit allowing her time to complete driving lessons and get her license so that she can move onto bigger things.`,

        copy: "In partnership with the Dutchess County Workforce Investment Board, Poughkeepsie Farm Project was able to provide a ten-week paid summer internship for six Poughkeepsie youth.  The youth crew was involved in every aspect of growing, harvesting, and distributing produce in the community - working both in the farm fields and our educational gardens. In addition to this hands-on training, the youth also gained knowledge about food access in their own community as they acted as youth ambassadors during community harvest events and free produce distributions. These programs highlighted the links between food justice and racial justice as youth explored the historical roots of racial injustices embedded in our nation’s food system.  The final project for the internship was creating an Anti-Racist Timeline and inviting all in the PFP community to consider how they are and can work towards being anti-racist advocates in their daily lives.  Over the course of the summer, the youth expressed the value of not only having a summer job, but also having a job through the year for both supporting their household finances and because of the positive relationships they develop with the adult staff members who serve as supervisors and mentors. This time of COVID also highlighted the importance of access to healthy food for the youth, who were able to take home a weekly share of the produce they helped to grow. Two of our summer interns, who also worked with us last summer and had previously volunteered at Poughkeepsie Farm Project, truly stood out and demonstrated their dedication to the community and to their own learning. We are thrilled that they are able to extend their internship through the fall season and possibly beyond. Young people like Tania and Rakim are our future and we look to them to lead the way toward a just and sustainable food system. "

This course was taught virtually and met for 4 weeks @ 20 hours per week with 5 additional hours of self-study each week.  The SYEP youth learned the basics of HTML & CSS: foundational skills in the world of computer programming; received a certificate of completion from the training provider; and an additional $800 incentive for those who successfully completed the online course and built their own website.  It is important to note that the youth in this web development class ranged from 14 to 17 years old and were able to create their own website after four weeks of class! Here’s a website created by Augustin, an SYEP participant who shares his interest in Psychology and how going to college and majoring in Psychology will help him understand how to help others.

The summer youth employment program funded by the Town of Hempstead Department of Occupational Resources at the Five Towns Community Center, was no exception. As we began to plan what the summer might look like for our youth workers, we had the wonderful opportunity to support our pantry that due to COVID-19 had become central to our efforts in assisting families in need. Prior to this global pandemic, Gammys Pantry at the Five Towns Community Center had been slowly growing. Thanks to partnerships with Long Island Cares and other organizations/donations, the pantry grew exponentially, which in turn required more volunteer support. 

        Typically youth workers are placed in sites such as our Summer Day Camp, maintenance, Headstart, and clerical settings but due to building capacity restrictions, those sites were unavailable. Gammy’s Pantry at the Five Towns Community Center turned out to be a great worksite for our youth. Youth engaged in in-person work experience participated in activities such as:  sorting donations received, set up/breakdown of distribution events, distribution of food items, maintenance of the onsite community garden, organization of the pantry, record keeping for the pantry.  Throughout their participation, youth acquired valuable organizational skills, communication skills, teambuilding, customer service skills, etc.
        
        Youth workers reported having had an “amazing experience” as they helped to organize and participate in distribution events (clothing and food), and “felt as if they were really helping others".  The summer program this year at the Five Towns Community Center definitely had a different feel to it. Not only did youth acquire transferable work skills but also developed a deeper connection to their community by way of their service. We are thankful that although COVID-19 created many challenges, that our youth were able to have this experience.`,

The LinkedIn partnership, cohorts, and final projects/presentations truly set the standard for not only meaningful virtual programming but for partnership development. With a team of three lead coordinators, LinkedIn was very hands-on and proactive, leading the way with many best practices. The entire LinkedIn team was genuinely committed to the youth they were serving and asked questions from beginning to end, working to refine their efforts and elevate their engagements. Youth explored more than just the LinkedIn platform; meaningful lessons about personal skills, self-worth, confidence-building, social capital, and professional development were all components of the LinkedIn partnership. The culminating activity and response to the Workplace Challenge yielded insight to what youth would recommend to LinkedIn to make their platform more ‘friendly,’ accessible, engaging, and beneficial to youth. LinkedIn invited senior leadership from the company who provided honest, productive feedback on select presentations, while youth offered honest and beneficial insights to the company about their platform. Here is a testimonial from a youth participant about their experience this summer “For me, it was one of the best opportunities I have had. I was able to work, I met new people, many people helped me, many things began to make sense that didn’t before. There were also some difficult things that I overcame, such as the language barrier.

His success came not only from two summers of working in the maintenance department at Pro Action of Steuben & Yates, Inc. and learning the soft and hard skills necessary to be a successful employee, but also from the required pre employment and financial literacy skills training required.  All aspects of this program were necessary for Rashawn to achieve the level of success that he now enjoys.   Rashawn was motivated to succeed when he began with SYE in the summer of 2019. However, he came with some of the barriers to success that are often associated with participants of the program. He did not have positive work role models at home, lived in generational poverty, had no transportation, struggled academically and did not possess any financial literacy skills, which resulted in him spending most of his paycheck soon after he received it. During the summer of 2019, Rashawn learned to work on a team, be a reliable employee (initially struggled with periodic days off), developed problem solving and decision-making skills and learned how to successfully communicate in a work environment.  Fast forward to the summer of 2020 during a worldwide pandemic where businesses in New York were open but operating under strict cleaning protocols. The manager of Pro Action’s maintenance department reached out to see if SYE was going to be funded and if Rashawn was interested in working. Due to Rashawn’s development as a worker in the previous summer, the manager felt he would be an asset to the department’s increased workload. Rashawn worked hard and assumed a leadership role within the maintenance department this summer. Daily, he executed the COVID-19 cleaning protocols to keep Pro Action’s three-story building within state compliance.  During his last week of SYE, a maintenance position was posted by the school district in Rashawn’s hometown which was within walking distance of his home. This opportunity would allow him to attend college during the day as his shift  did not begin until 3PM, in addition to providing him with a full benefits package. Rashawn is now a full-time college student at Corning Community College, is a full-time employee of Haverling Central School District and has moved into his own apartment with a roommate. He is happy to share his story and hopes it inspires all youth who hear it. "

A normal program year we would be teaching the youth to implement enrichments within our Power Scholars Academy Program at the YMCA of Greater Rochester. Our summer program with youth was a OCFS licensed program and due to  COVID-19 we didn't allow the program participants to be in classrooms with youth due to safety and licensing concerns. However as an organization we pivoted from doing our program in person but into a program year that allowed us to do our normal programming virtually and provide youth with financial Literacy, job readiness training, and most importantly teaching youth how to implement enrichment programming with young people within a child care setting. We taught the youth how to write STEM and Art lesson plans based on the YMCA 9-Core component model that the YMCA follows. Participants were able to see professional lesson plans and were able to write their own lesson plans within a small group. They gained necessary skills to be able to hopefully get into a career in youth development and implement successful programming. <br> As an organization we are extremely proud that we were able to pivot in such a different way than the year before.Given the circumstances of what was going on throughout the world with COVID - 19 and social injustice issues we were able to successfully complete a program that gave the youth a voice and gave the youth opportunities to grow within themselves.Our success has contributed to youth willing to take the chance on us to lead them and most importantly taking the chance within themselves to try new things or something much different than they have done in the past.I would say all the youth participants were the champions of this program and their willingness to adapt to our world/ program is our success story."

        copy: "At WIB Inc dba Chautauqua Works every youth participates in a two hour orientation that contains an educational component including logistics of the program, workplace behavior, workplace safety, sexual harassment prevention, COVID-19 health and safety requirements, and financial literacy.  During the program, youth have the opportunity to participate in additional career based educational activities including a career word search activity and a testimonial of their experience in the program.  At the conclusion of the program, youth will complete a resume during a three hour wrap-up session which also includes a workshop on completing a job application and work readiness skills. An additional educational component for 14-15 year olds was developed this year.  It consisted of two 3 hour sessions per week at the Chautauqua Works Jamestown office.  In addition to those sessions, youth were offered activities to complete that provided additional paid employment hours.  Caleb, a young adult participant who worked at  Michael's AJ’s Texas Hots, shares that his favorite part of his experience thi summer was the flexibility he was granted from his worksite and the support he received from the program. Caleb looks forward to pursuing a career in Law Enforcement or Psychology."
