                Launched in the late 1970s, NYATEP was founded by a small group of
                professionals dedicated to collaborating to increase the effectiveness
                of federally funded workforce programs. In the last 40 years, the
                organization has grown to be New Yorkâ€™s statewide workforce
                development association. Our members support more than a million New
                Yorkers achieve good or better jobs through education, employment,
                training and supportive services. NYATEP is a membership based, 501c3
                non-profit, intermediary that provides leadership, vision, and
                advocacy for a thriving workforce development network across New York
                State.{" "}
